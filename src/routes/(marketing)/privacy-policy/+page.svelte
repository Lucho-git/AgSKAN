  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>About this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    {companyName} (referred to as "SKAN", "we", "us", or "our") is committed to respecting
    your right to privacy and protecting your personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Policy applies to all your dealings with us when you use our services,
    whether in person, or via telephone, email, correspondence, our website,
    social media or otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>The purpose of this Policy is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Give you a better and more complete understanding of the kinds of personal
      information we collect and hold;
    </li>
    <li>
      Clearly and concisely communicate how and when we collect, disclose, use,
      store and otherwise handle personal information;
    </li>
    <li>
      Inform you about the purposes for which we collect, hold, use and disclose
      personal information;
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide you with information about how you may access your personal
      information, and seek correction of your personal information;
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide you with information about how you may make a complaint, and how
      we will deal with any such complaint;
    </li>
    <li>
      Advise you of the circumstances in which we are likely to disclose
      personal information to recipients in other countries, if applicable; and
    </li>
    <li>Enhance the transparency of our operations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For the purpose of this Policy, <strong>Personal Information</strong> means information
    or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably
    identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not, and whether
    the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not. This may include,
    for example, your name, contact details, and information about your use of our
    services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sensitive Information</strong> is a subset of personal information that
    is generally afforded a higher level of privacy protection. Examples might include
    information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious
    beliefs, or health information. We will only collect sensitive information if
    it is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities and with your explicit
    consent, or if the collection is required or authorized by law. For our farming
    agtech services, we typically do not need to collect this type of information.
  </p>

  <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
  <p>
    We will, if it is reasonable or practicable to do so, collect your personal
    information directly from you. This may happen when you fill out a form,
    create an account, subscribe to our services, or when you give us personal
    information in person, or via telephone, email, correspondence, our website,
    or social media.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might also provide personal information about other individuals to us
    (e.g., an authorized representative for your farming operation). If so, we
    rely on you to have obtained their authority to release their personal
    information to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes we may collect personal information from a third party or a
    publicly available source if it is relevant to the services we provide you
    (e.g., publicly available agricultural data) and if it's unreasonable or
    impractical to collect it directly from you.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we receive personal information that we did not solicit, we will
    determine as soon as reasonably practicable whether we could have lawfully
    collected that information as part of our functions or activities. If we are
    not satisfied that we could have lawfully collected the information, then we
    will (if it is lawful and reasonable) destroy the information or ensure that
    it is de-identified.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may choose to deal with us anonymously or under a pseudonym where lawful
    and practical. However, where anonymity or use of a pseudonym will render us
    unable to provide the relevant services or do business with you (e.g., for
    account management, billing, or providing specific farm data services), we
    may request that you identify yourself.
  </p>

  <h3>Information we collect from users</h3>
  <p>
    When you use our farming agtech services, we may collect personal
    information in order to provide and improve those services to you. We strive
    to only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary for, or
    directly related to, one or more of the services we provide or functions we
    carry out.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use free informational services available on our website, you might
    be required to create a username (which may be a pseudonym) and/or provide
    your email address for updates or access.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use our paid services, platform, or services requiring an account, we
    may collect the following types of personal information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name.</li>
    <li>Farm or Company name (if applicable).</li>
    <li>Email address.</li>
    <li>Phone number.</li>
    <li>Billing address.</li>
    <li>
      Financial information including credit card details or bank account
      details for payment processing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Information related to your farm operations that you provide for use with
      our services (e.g., field locations, crop types, sensor data, operational
      practices).
    </li>
    <li>
      Other information you voluntarily provide to us to tailor your service
      experience or for support.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Some of the information we may ask you to provide may be identified as
    mandatory to enable us to provide the core service. If you do not provide
    the mandatory data, we may be unable to provide the services requested by
    you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like many websites and online platforms, we may utilize “cookies” and
    similar technologies which automatically collect information to help us
    recognize you, customize your experience, and improve our services. For
    example, when visiting our website or using our platform, we may
    automatically record information that your browser or device sends such as
    the web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating
    system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network
    carrier, time zone and general location (e.g., country or city). Our
    third-party service providers may also help us to track activity within our
    services. A cookie does not identify you personally but may identify your
    internet service provider or computer. You can usually set your browser to
    notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an
    opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance. Rejecting
    cookies may affect your ability to use some features of our services.
  </p>

  <h2>Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
  <p>
    Personal information collected by SKAN will ordinarily be used for the
    following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Providing you with the agtech services and platform access requested.
    </li>
    <li>
      To modify, improve, and develop the services provided to you and other
      users.
    </li>
    <li>Customer support and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li>To manage the contractual relationship between you and SKAN.</li>
    <li>User and business relationship management.</li>
    <li>To perform audits, security and fraud monitoring and prevention.</li>
    <li>To process transactions and manage billing.</li>
    <li>
      To ask for feedback, ratings, and reviews of the products and services we
      offer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Marketing of products and services to you (with your consent where
      required, and always with an option to opt-out).
    </li>
    <li>
      To comply with legal process or to protect SKAN’s interests and legal
      rights.
    </li>
    <li>
      For data aggregation and anonymization to generate insights, improve our
      services, and for research (ensuring individual users are not
      identifiable).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In order to achieve the purposes described above, we may disclose your
    personal information to the persons/organizations described below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your authorized representative or advisor (if you provide consent).</li>
    <li>
      Third-party service providers engaged by us who assist in providing parts
      of our service (such as payment processors, data hosting providers, cloud
      computing services, analytics providers, and customer support tools). We
      ensure these providers have appropriate safeguards for your information.
    </li>
    <li>
      Persons or organizations involved in marketing goods and services on our
      behalf (where you have consented).
    </li>
    <li>
      Government agencies or other persons/organizations if required by law or
      to comply with legal obligations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Organizations involved in maintaining, reviewing, and developing our
      business systems, procedures and infrastructure including maintaining or
      upgrading our computer systems.
    </li>
    <li>
      Potential purchasers or new owners if SKAN is involved in a merger,
      acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets (in such cases,
      information is typically shared under confidentiality agreements).
    </li>
    <li>
      Organizations involved in the payments systems including financial
      institutions, merchants and payment organizations.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We will only use and disclose personal information for the primary purpose
    for which it was initially collected, for directly related secondary
    purposes that you would reasonably expect, or for other purposes to which
    you have consented.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will not disclose your personal information to other third parties unless
    one of the following applies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have consented.</li>
    <li>
      You would reasonably expect, or you have been told, that information of
      that kind is usually passed to those individuals, bodies or agencies for a
      specific purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is otherwise required or authorized by law (e.g., by a court order or
      subpoena).
    </li>
    <li>
      It is reasonably necessary for enforcement related activities conducted
      by, or on behalf of, a law enforcement body.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If we transfer your personal information to a recipient in another country
    (for example, if we use cloud services with servers located overseas), we
    will take reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient handles
    your personal information in a manner consistent with recognized privacy
    principles and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
  </p>

  <h2>Marketing our products and services</h2>
  <p>
    SKAN may use or disclose your personal information to let you know about
    products and services (including new features, offers, or events) in which
    you may be interested, where we have your consent or a legitimate interest
    to do so. You can contact us at any time if you no longer wish us to market
    our products and services to you (see the Contacting Us section for more
    information), or use the unsubscribe mechanism provided in our marketing
    communications.
  </p>

  <h2>Accuracy of Personal Information</h2>
  <p>
    SKAN will take reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information it
    collects, uses or discloses is accurate, complete and up-to-date. We rely on
    you to provide us with accurate and current information.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you believe your personal information held by us is not accurate,
    complete or up-to-date, please contact us (see the Contacting Us section for
    more information).
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    Your personal information may be stored in hard copy documents (though
    primarily electronically for our services). SKAN is committed to keeping
    your personal information secure and safe. Some of the ways we do this are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Implementing technical and organizational security measures appropriate to
      the risk, such as encryption, access controls, and network security.
    </li>
    <li>
      Secure hard copy document storage (if applicable, in locked filing
      cabinets).
    </li>
    <li>Security measures for access to our computer systems and platform.</li>
    <li>
      Requiring employees and contractors who handle personal information to
      maintain confidentiality.
    </li>
    <li>Security measures for our websites and online services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will review and update our security measures from time to time.</p>
  <p>
    We will also review the personal information held by us from time to time,
    ensuring that information which is no longer needed for a purpose for which
    it was initially collected (and for which there is no legal or operational
    retention requirement) is securely destroyed or de-identified.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Privacy on the Internet</h2>
  <p>
    SKAN takes care to ensure that the information you provide to us via our
    website and platform is protected. For example, our online services have
    electronic security systems in place, which may include the use of
    firewalls, data encryption, and secure authentication protocols.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may be able to access external websites by clicking on links we have
    provided on our website. Those other websites are not subject to our privacy
    standards, policies and procedures. You will need to contact or review those
    websites directly to ascertain their privacy standards, policies and
    procedures.
  </p>

  <h2>Deletion of and access to Personal Information</h2>
  <p>
    If you would like SKAN to delete your platform data or personal information
    permanently from our active records (excluding data which we may be required
    to keep for legal, accounting, auditing purposes, or for backup and disaster
    recovery until it is cycled out according to our retention policies), you
    may do so by contacting us (see the Contacting Us section for more
    information). Your information will be deleted from our active systems as
    soon as reasonably possible and in accordance with applicable law. Please
    note that some data, once anonymized and aggregated, may be retained for
    analytical purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may request access to personal information that SKAN holds about you
    (see the Contacting Us section for more information).
  </p>
  <p>
    We will acknowledge your request within a reasonable timeframe of the
    request being made. Access will usually be granted within a reasonable
    period, typically within one month, unless the request is complex or
    involves voluminous information, in which case we may extend this period as
    permitted by law. We will inform you if any delays are anticipated.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need to verify your identity before access to your personal
    information is granted or corrections/deletions are made.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once your request has been processed, we will endeavor to make the
    information available to you in the manner requested by you unless it is
    unreasonable for us to do so (e.g., providing a data export or secure online
    access).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are aware that we hold personal information about you that is no
    longer accurate, complete or up-to-date, please contact us (see the
    Contacting Us section for more information) to request a correction.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you request access to your personal information, or if you request that
    we correct your personal information, we will allow access or make the
    correction unless we consider that there is a sound reason under applicable
    law to withhold the information, or not make the correction.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may refuse to grant access or make a correction to personal information
    under certain circumstances as permitted by law, for example, if:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Granting access would pose a serious threat to the life, health, or safety
      of any individual.
    </li>
    <li>
      Granting access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of
      other individuals.
    </li>
    <li>The request is frivolous, vexatious, or manifestly unfounded.</li>
    <li>
      Denial of access is required or authorized by law or by a Court or
      Tribunal order.
    </li>
    <li>
      Giving access would reveal commercially sensitive information or prejudice
      legal proceedings.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If we do not agree to make a correction to your personal information, you
    may provide a statement about the requested corrections, and we will ensure
    that the statement is noted with the relevant personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we do not agree to provide access to your personal information or to
    correct your personal information, we will provide written reasons for the
    refusal and the mechanisms available to complain about the refusal.
