      This is where we want to be as a company, a live, interactive tool with
      all the features of our stationary product. This tool will auto-update in
      the paddock if someone makes a wrong turn, bin/tank/box storage
      capacities, and the ability to calculate the next fill-up.

      Imagine a world where the seed/fert truck gets placed in the right spot
      every time, and there is no more guesswork about when to pull out for a
      fill. Saving minutes, saving money.

      PaddockPlan - Harvest
    </h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Harvest can be chaotic, chasing weather, chasing time, chasing profits.
      Let us simplify this job, we will create a PaddockPlan tool like never
      before. A complete logistics platform that communicates with harvesters,
      chaser bins, trucks, and field bins.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Chaser bins will know exactly what run line to be on when the headers are
      full, the headers will know exactly when they are going to be full. The
      trucks will know how much grain is in the bin, the boss will know where
      everyone is up to, all without touching the two-way.
